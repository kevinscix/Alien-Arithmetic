## Description
Our educational game's main focus is creating an educational and entertaining experience for young children. This game's goal is to teach kids simple math (basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with visually stimulating imagery and game play. Our game takes inspiration from the classic Space Invaders, where the player must destroy the obstacle corresponding to the answer of a given math equation. The player will control a ship with a math equation appearing on the screen. Asteroids will start approaching the player's ship, each with a different number on it. The player must destroy the asteroid with the correct number on it to continue, where the process repeats.
