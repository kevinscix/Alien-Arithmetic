## Description
Our educational game's main focus is creating an educational and entertaining experience for young children. This game's goal is to teach kids simple math (basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with visually stimulating imagery and game play. Our game takes inspiration from the classic Space Invaders, where the player must destroy the obstacle corresponding to the answer of a given math equation. The player will control a ship with a math equation appearing on the screen. Asteroids will start approaching the player's ship, each with a different number on it. The player must destroy the asteroid with the correct number on it to continue, where the process repeats.

#### Development Environment
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is the code editor that we will be using as it provides some essential features to allow us to seamlessly develop the program. Pydoc is the built-in documentation tool that we will use to document the code effectively. It provides valuable information on modules, classes, functions, and methods. The unittest framework will allow us to write and run tests allowing us to define organize and execute them to ensure the code is correct.
For external libraries, Pygame is a library for developing games in Python which we will be using. It provides functionalities for handling graphics, sound, input devices, and other aspects of game development, making it suitable for implementing the game. Pydantic is a library for data manipulation and validation. It provides a way to model data for the asteroid, player, and scoreboard class to be stored in a CSV file or converted into JSON based on the requirements of the project.
Additional tools we will be using are Bitbucket, Jira, and Confluence. Bitbucket for version control, Jira for project management, Confluence for collaborative documentation and diagrams, and established coding standards to maintain code consistency. The application, designed for Windows 10 systems, will be self-contained, requiring no internet connection, and will s
